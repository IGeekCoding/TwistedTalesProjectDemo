[+] Description:
  Twisted Tales is a 4 person grouped project for the Spring CS-3443 class, aiming to create a visual novel based upon the grim brother fairy tale stories. As of the recent updates towards the app, we now have two storylines to
  pursue as Hansel and Grettle or Little Red Riding Hood. The stories can be chosen by the viewer change and alter the events as the user can hope to find the best solutions for the fates of the characters. The stories are depicted
  with originally drawn characters by one of the developers (NadTriJon) and accompanied by royalty free background pictures.

[+] Installation:
  Before installing our application, please ensure that you have Android Studio installed and prepared beforehand. Once done, install and unzip the application to your desination of choice upon your device. Lastly, open up the
  app and follow the on screen buttons to begin your visual novel experience!

[+] Bugs/Issues:
  - View Button: Deemed as cut content due to complications with the code
  - Settings: Proved to be much more challenging as a side task and thus became cut content
  - Back Button: Came across a visual bug for implementation and use
  - Storyline: One of the options along the storyline for HAG (Hansel and Grettle) does not function properly, but it does not disrupt the user experience till late game
